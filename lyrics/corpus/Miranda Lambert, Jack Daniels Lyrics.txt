Song: 
Album: 
Daddy always said that he was wrong for me,
And in the end he'd only bring me misery.
I tried and tried to turn away,
but something 'bout him makes me stay.
The only man whose ever knocked me to my knees.
The only man whose ever set my spirit free.
He was born and raised in Lynchburg, Tennessee.
His daddy owns a big distillery.
He's an old time whiskey drinker,
when I'm with him I get meaner,
And mama says he's ruined my destiny.
Well, he sure has made a woman out of me.
I fell in love with Jack Daniels again.
He's the best kind of lover that there is.
I can have him when I please, he always satisfies my needs,
He takes me back no matter where I've been.
Yeah, I fell in love with Jack Daniels again.
(Instrumental Break)
I fell in love with Jack Daniels again.
He's the best kind of lover that there is.
I can have him when I please, he always satisfies my needs,
He takes me back no matter where I've been.
Yeah, I fell in love with Jack Daniels again.
Jack Daniels, if you please,
Knock me to my knees.
You're the only friend there has ever been, that didn't do me wrong.
Jack Daniels, if you please,
Knock me to my knees.
You can kill this pain, that's drivin' me insane, since my baby's gone.
