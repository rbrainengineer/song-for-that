Song: 
Album: 
Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton
Feelings,
Just lead us on til we know,
Where we're going,
Mmmm mmmmmm.
If I told you that I loved you,
Could we slip away, where the lights are low?
And if I put my arms around you and held you close, could you tell me no?
Well you know that I'd be lyin',
If I said I wasn't tryin' to let you know, I'd go.
Let love take us where we've never been before.
Feelings
Just lead us on til we know,
Where we're going.
Mmmm mmmmmm
You don't know how long I've wanted to have you,
Where you are right now.
With you lookin' so damn pretty,
Their ain't no tellin' where we're bound.
Now here we are together,
Too close for talkin',
I can't tell you no.
Let love take us where we've never been before.
Feelings,
Just lead us on til we know,
Where we're going,
Mmmmm mmmmmm.
Feelings,
Mmmmm mmmmmm.
