Song: 
Album: 
I put a bullet in my radio
Something just hit me funny I don’t know
Just pulled the trigger going down the road
You slammed the door and knocked me off the wire
Been walking lines and you’ve been burning tires
Slow and uneasy ain’t that what you like
It’s insane
It’s in vain
You stay to maintain the pain
I hear your name and man it burns a hole
I swear I hate you but I can’t let go
The kind of damage that you can’t console
It’s all in vain
It’s all insane
I swear you’ll stay
I swear you’ll stay to maintain the pain
It’s all in vain
It’s all insane
I swear you’ll stay
I swear you’ll stay to maintain the pain
Maintain the pain
