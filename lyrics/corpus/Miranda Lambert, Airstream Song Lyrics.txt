Song: 
Album: 
Sometimes I wish I lived in an Airstream
Homemade curtains, lived just like a gypsy
Break a heart, roll out of town
‘Cause gypsies never get tied down
Sometimes I wish I lived on a mountain
Drank from a stream instead of a fountain
I’d stay there, top of the world
But I was born a red dirt girl
Unbridled or tethered and tied
The safety of the fence or the danger of the ride
I’ll always be unsatisfied
Sometimes I wish I lived by a pier
In a lighthouse with a chandelier
I’d watch everybody’s ships come in
And then I’d sail away with them
Unanchored in the storm
Or safely on the shore
If this is all I need, why do I want more
Sometimes I wish I lived in an airstream
Homemade curtains, lived just like a gypsy
