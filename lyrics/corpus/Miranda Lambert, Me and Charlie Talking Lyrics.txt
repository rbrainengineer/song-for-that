Me and Charlie boy used to go walking
Sittin in the woods behind my house
When bein lovers meant a stolen kiss
And holding hands with nobody else around
Charlie said he wanted to get married
But we were only ten so we’d have to wait
He said we’d never let our love run dry 
Like so many do these days
So we treat our love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar
With holes in the top 
And run like hell to show it off
Oh promises we made when we’d go walkin
That’s just me and Charlie talking
Charlie always said he’d like to leave here
So he turned 18 and left our sleepy town
Letters came and went and I kept waiting
For Charlie to come back
And bring the life he’d found
Funny how time and distance change you
The road you take 
Don’t always lead you home
You can start a love with good intentions
And you look up and it’s gone
So you treat your love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar
With holes in the top 
And run like hell to show it off
Oh promises we made when we’d go walkin
That’s just me and Charlie talking
Now and then I sometimes think of Charlie
How we thought we knew it all back then
Now I’d give anything to feel love
From a child’s heart again
So you treat your love like a firefly
Like it only gets to shine for a little while
Catch it in a mason jar
With holes in the top 
And run like hell to show it off
Oh promises we made when we’d go walkin
That’s just me and Charlie 
Me and Charlie talking
