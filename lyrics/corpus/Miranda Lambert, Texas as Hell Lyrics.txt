Song: 
Album: 
I'm Texas as hell
mean 'n ornery
I don't need no loud mouth
comin' on to me
my temper gets hotter than red white and blue blazes
you know dog-gone well everybody can tell I'm Texas as hell
well I know I haven't been around a long time
but I've heard my share of
those worn out love lines
if you ain't redneck 
dont waste your time
because right now I'm in a lonestar state of mind
and I'm Texas as hell
mean 'n ornery
I don't need no loud mouth
comin on to me
my temper gets hotter than red white and blue blazes
you know dog-gone well everybody can tell
I'm Texas as hell
well I guess you think that I'll be persuaded
but how many times do I have to say this
don't mess with me boy
for heaven's sake
didnt anybody tell you messin with Texas was a big mistake
cus' I'm Texas as hell
I'm mean 'n ornery
I don't need no loud mouth comin on to me
my temper gets hotter than red white and blue blazes
you know dog-gone well everybody can tell 
I'm Texas as hell
you know dog-gone well everybody can tell I'm Texas as hell
yeah
