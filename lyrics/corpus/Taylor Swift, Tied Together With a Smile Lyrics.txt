Song: 
Album: 
Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true, cause I know you
Hold on baby you're losing it
The water's high you're jumping in to it 
And letting go and no one knows
That you cry but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone
Guess its true that love is all you wanted
Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket 
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain
Oh cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay
Hold on baby you're losing it
The water's high you're jumping in to it 
And letting go and no one knows
That you cry but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone
oh oh oh oh
Hold on baby you're losing it
The water's high you're jumping in to it 
And letting go and no one knows
That you cry but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone
oh oh oh oh
You're tied together with a smile but you're coming undone
