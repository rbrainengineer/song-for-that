Song: 
Album: 
I wanna drink till I feel pretty
I wanna laugh till you get mad
I wanna dance with three more strangers
Till you get over what you have
Chorus
I can feel you starin' at me
And I just love good irony
The only shot you've got's one more tequila
'Cause I ain't nobody's used to be
It's getting late, a little lonely
And what you're thinkin's all too clear
Lucky for you I've had too many
I'm just drunk enough to leave you here
Chorus
You can stop anticipatin'
Just go home, I know she's waitin'
And I know you'll be wishin' it was me
Honey, I ain't nobody's used to be
