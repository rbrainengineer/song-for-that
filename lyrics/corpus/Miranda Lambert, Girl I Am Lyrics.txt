Song: 
Album: 
You don't need a girl like me
I got bruises you can't see
When the lights go out I won't be around
You don't need a girl like me
You can't have a heart like mine
But you can hold it for a while
When the lights go out I won't be around
You can't have a heart like mine
There's a rule that goes unwritten
And I break it from time to time
If you're fool enough to listen
That I'm fool enough to lie
That's the kind of girl I am
I take off before I land
And even though you think you can
You can't change the way I am
Cause the rule remains unwritten
I still break it from time to time
If you're fool enough to listen
And I'm fool enough to lie
You can't change the way I am
You don't need a girl like me
