Song: 
Album: 
Throw a dog a bone I'll take it if I have to
Go real fast like there's somewhere we can get to
Whats the use in standin' right there on the edge 
if there ain't nowhere to fall
whats the use in hangin on tight to the phone if nobody might call
Desperation
There's danger in frustration
complicated words slippin' off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth
I'm still desperate for you.
Tell it like a lie live it like a movie
Give a heart away like it don't me nothin' to me
whats the use in makin' all the plans that we made
if you weren't gonna go
whats the use in slappin on a smile for a face
if your eyes don't wanna show
Desperation
There's danger in frustration
complicated words slippin' off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth
I'm still desperate for you.
Well it's too damn bad you didn't have a chance
to make me your best friend
you were too caught up in givin' too much up 
and not doin' what you should have been
Desperation
There's danger in frustration
complicated words slippin' off of your tongue and ain't one of them the truth
I'm still desperate for you.
