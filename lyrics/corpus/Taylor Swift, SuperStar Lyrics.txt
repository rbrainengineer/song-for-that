Song: 
Album: 
This is wrong but, I can't help but feel like there ain't more right babe. 
Misty morning, comes again and I can't help but wish I could see your face. 
I knew from the first note played I'd be, breaking all my rules to see you. 
And you smile that beauitful smile, and all the girls in the front row, scream your name.
So dim that spotlight tell me things like, I can't take my eyes off of you. 
I'm no one special just another wide eyed girl, who's desperatly in love with you.
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, 
superstar.
Good morning loneliness, comes around when I'm not, dreaming about you. 
When my world wakes up today, 
you'll be in another town.
I knew when i saw your face I'd be
counting down the ways to see you. 
and you smile that beautiful smile, and all the girls in the front scream your name.
So dim that spotlight tell me things like, I can't take my eyes off of you. 
I'm no one special just another wide eyed girl, who's desperatly in love with you.
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, 
superstar.
You played in bars, you play guitar.
I'm invisible, and everyone knows who you are.
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night on the radio. 
So dim that spotlight tell me things like, I can't take my eyes off of you. 
I'm no one special just another wide eyed girl, who's desperatly in love with you.
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, 
superstar.
Sweet, sweet superstar. 
Superstar.
