Song: 
Album: 
keep trying to fight it
am i lost or misguided
seems like everything lately is making me mad
is it you that i'm missing
or just someone to listen
theres more questions than answers
and nobody's asked
i stopped calling you baby
because it just stopped feeling right
and i'm not looking for someone to save me
just a place for my heart to unwind
so i sit here with your picture
a cigarette and a tea glass of wine
and then i'll see what you mean to me
cus' i can't decide between you and your memory
there's no place to hide between you and your memory
