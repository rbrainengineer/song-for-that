Song: 
Album: 
well there's somethin that I like about a honky tonk
whiskey drinkin cowboys and lonesome country songs
wonderin if I'll fall in love or if I won't
well there's somethin that I like about a honky tonk
guess that all my life I've been a runnin' round
playin all the honky tonks from town to town
I'm just not the kind to ever settle down
and a honky tonk's the only love I've ever found
there's somethin' that I like about a honky tonk
whiskey drinkin cowboys and lonesome country songs
wonderin if I'll fall in love or if I won't
there's somethin that I like about a honky tonk
well I've had my share of dancin' partners that's for sure
but I've never two-stepped my way into love before
but every night you'll see me crawlin back for more
cus' I just can't seem to stay away from swingin doors
well there's somethin that i like about a honky tonk
there's somethin that i like about a honky tonk
whiskey drinkin; cowboys and lonesome country songs
wonderin' if I'll fall in love or if I won't
well there's somethin that I like about a honky tonk
there's somethin that I like
about those neon lights
there's somethin that I like about a honky tonk
