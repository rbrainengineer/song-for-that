Hey white liar
the truth comes out a little at a time
and it spreads just like a fire
slips off of your tongue like turpentine
and i don ́t know why
white liar
you better be careful what you do
i wouldn ́t wanna be in your shoes
if they ever found you out
you better be careful what you say
it never really added up any way
I got friends in this town
Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
and it spreads just like a fire
slips off of your tongue like turpentine
and I don ́t know why
white liar
You said you went out to a bar
and walked some lady to her car
but your face has more to tell
cuz my cousin saw you on the street
with a red head named Bernice
Turns out you don ́t lie too well
Hey white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
and it spreads just like a fire
slips off of your tongue like turpentine
and I don ́t know why
white liar
Here ́s a bombshell just for you
turns out I ́ve been lying too
Yeah I ́m a white liar
The truth comes out a little at a time
and it spreads just like a fire
slips off of my tongue like turpentine
and I don ́t know why
White Liar
