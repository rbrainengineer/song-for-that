Song: 
Album: 
It's a sad picture;
The final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted and you can't win,
You know it's all the same,
Another time and place,
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do,
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change...
Chorus:
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back
will fall down,
It's a revolution,
The time will come for us to finally win,
And we'll sing
Hallelujah
We'll sing
Hallelujah
Oh
So we've been outnumbered,
Raided and now cornered,
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair,
We're getting stronger now,
found things they never found,
They might be bigger,
but we're faster and never scared.
You can walk away say "We don't need this"
But there's something in your eyes
says "We can beat this".
Because these things will change...
Chorus:
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down,
It's a revolution,
The time will come for us to finally win,
And we'll sing
Hallelujah
We'll sing
Hallelujah
Oh
Tonight we'll stand,
Get off our knees,
Fight for what we've worked for all these years,
and the battle was long,
It's the fight of our lives,
When we stand up,
Champions tonight
It was the night things changed,
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back...fell down,
It's a revolution,
Throw your hands up,
'cause we never gave in,
And we'll sing
Hallelujah
We sang
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Yeah
