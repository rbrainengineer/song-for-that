Song: 
Album: 
Elevator buttons and morning air
Stranger silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lipgloss smiles
But I don't care
Cause right now you're mine
And you'll say,
So don't you worry your pretty little mind,
People throw rocks at things that shine
and life makes love look hard.
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours.
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough but they are where mine belong in
I'll fight their doubts and give you faith with this song for you
Cause I love the gap between your teeth
and I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos will be ignored
Cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
But don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
