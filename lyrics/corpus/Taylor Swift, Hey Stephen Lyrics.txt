Song: 
Album: 
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin' 
But I know I saw a light in you 
And as we walked we were talking 
I didn't say half the things I wanted to 
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window 
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold 
Hey Stephen, boy you might have me believin' 
I don't always have to be alone 
[CHORUS] 
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel 
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you 
Can't help it if there's no one else 
I can't help myself 
Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feelin' 
So I've got some things to say to you 
I've seen it all, so I thought 
But I've never seen no body shine the way you do 
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name 
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change 
Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin' 
I think you and I should stay the same 
[CHORUS] 
Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel 
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you 
Can't help it if there's no one else 
I can't help myself 
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me 
Why aren't you here tonight? 
I'm waiting alone now so come on and come out 
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine 
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons 
Why I should be the one you choose 
All those other girls, well they're beautiful 
But would they write a song for you? 
Haha 
[CHORUS] 
I can't help it if you look like an angel 
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you 
Can't help it if there's no one else 
I can't help myself 
[CHORUS] 
If you look like an angel 
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so 
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you 
Can't help it if there's no one else 
I can't help myself, myself 
Can't help myself 
I can't help myself
