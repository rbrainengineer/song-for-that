Song: 
Album: 
What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing
Would the song stil survive without 5 golden rings
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe
What would happen if God never let it snow
What would happen if Christmas Carols told a lie
Tell me what you would find
You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
What if angels did not pay attention to 
All the things that we wish they would always do
What if happiness came in a cardboard box
Then I'd think there was somethingwe all forgot
What would happenif presents all went away
Tell me what would you find
You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more
We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
100 mile an hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind
You'd say that today holds something special
Something holy and not superficial
So here's to jesus christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something 
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more
There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more
