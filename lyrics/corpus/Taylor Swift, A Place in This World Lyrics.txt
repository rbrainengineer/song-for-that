Song: 
Album: 
I dont know what i want, So dont ask me, cause im still trying to figure it out. 
Don't know what's down this road, 
im just walking.
Trying to see through the rain coming down.
Even though im not the only one,
that feels the way i do.
Im alone, on my own, and that's all i know.
I'll be strong, i'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on. 
Oh, im just a girl, trying to find a place in this world.
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans,
And im wearing my heart on my sleeve. Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine.
Can you tell me what more do i need? 
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah, 
but that's okay.
Im alone, on my own, and that's all i know.
I'll be strong, i'll be wrong,
Oh, but life goes on. 
Oh, im just a girl, trying to find a place in this world.
Maybe im just a girl on a mission, 
but im ready to fly.
Im alone, on my own, and that's all i know.
Oh, i'll be strong, i'll be wrong.
Oh, but life goes on.
Oh, im alone, on my own, 
and that's all i know. 
Oh, im just a girl, trying to find a place in this world.
Oh, im just a girl.
Oh, im just a girl.
Oh, oh.
Oh, im just a girl.
