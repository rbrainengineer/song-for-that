Song: 
Album: 
I met him on the edge of a good bye
i was standing there with no where left to fly
i was young but never green
a little wiser than my time it seemed
he told me bout the places we could hide
wild and kind of crazy most the time
my heart was hanging on his every line
i memorized his every thought
but the walls he had could never be brought down
and now he's not around
i guess i'm just a face left in the crowd
oh california
please come back to me
oh california
you're who i want to be
live inside of me
a vivid picture plays inside my head
the things you swore we'd never do again
and he put on that LA face 
and he left me with a bittersweet taste of life
and thats enough to keep me alive
i know you're lying somewhere in the arms of destiny
your memory it still lingers here and i'll never set it free
oh california
please come back to me 
oh california
you're who i want to be
live inside of me
live inside of me
