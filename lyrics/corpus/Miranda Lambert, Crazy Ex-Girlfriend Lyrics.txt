Song: 
Album: 
It took me five bars, some thirty license plates
I saw her mustang and my eyes filled up with rage
I brought my pistol, but I ain't some kind of fool
So I walked right in barehanded, she was on his arm while he was playin' pool
Just like I used to do
She kissed him while I got a beer, well she didn't think I'd show up here
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
I watched her for a while but I didn't like her walk
Came across kinda cheap to me, but hey, how's that my fault
She looked at my man like he didn't have on a stitch
Somebody tell that girl to step up to the plate, i'm gonna pitch
Little bitch
Those pretty girls can play their game
But their damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy ex-girlfriend
Well I started throwin' things and I scared folks half to death
I got up in his face and smelled whiskey on his breath
Didn't give a second thought to being thrown in jail
Cause baby to hammer everything looks like a nail
And I was mad as hell
Well those pretty girls their all the same
But their damn well gonna know my name
I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend 
I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend 
I'm a crazy Ex-Girlfriend
