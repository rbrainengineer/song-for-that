Song: 
Album: 
I have been draggin' around your sensitive ego
Making sure that your bags arrive on time for the dog and pony show
Little suitcase like a brick, 
Kinda makes it hard to get a good grip
I drop your troubles off at a conveyor belt, 
I'll hand you a ticket to go get it yourself
At the baggage claim, you got a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the ground, check the lost and found
'Cause it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of troubles all my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car, 
I'm packin' it in so come and get it.
If it ain't obvious what has set me off today, 
Behind every woman scorend is a man who made her that way
Go on take your little buisness trip with that sweet little habit
That you just can't kick
You better call your momma when you get to town because I won't be hangin' around
At the baggage claim, you gott a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the gorund, check the lost and found
Because it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of trobules of my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car, 
I'm packin' it in so come and get it
Come N' Get it
Come and pick it up, pick it up
Before I blow it up and flames
Pick it up, pick it up, 
Baby, I'm leaving everything... 
At the baggage claim, you gott a lot of luggage in your name
When you hit the gorund, check the lost and found
Because it ain't my problem now
I can't carry it on, I've got a lot of trobules of my own
It's all over the yard, in the trunk of the car, 
I'm packin' it in so come and get it
Come and get it!
