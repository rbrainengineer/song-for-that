Song: 
Album: 
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around.
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down.
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out.
And you think it will be fine again but not this time around.
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, ohh no no no
Looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know.
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold.
And you've got your share of secrets and I'm tired of being last to know.
And now you're asking me to listen cause it's worked each time before.
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, ohh no no no
You're not sorry ohh no no
You had me calling for you honey and it never would have gone away, no.
You used to shine so bright but I watch all of it fade.
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you baby
Like I did before
You're not sorry, ohh no no
You're not sorry ohh no no no
