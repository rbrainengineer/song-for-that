Song: 
Album: 
In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Trying to make me stay
I said that this time, I've had enough
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up
Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer
I said leave but all I really want is you 
To stand outside my window
Throwing pebbles screaming "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 
Cause I know all I need is on 
The other side of the door
Me and my stupid pride are sittin here alone
Goin through the photographs
Staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread
So babe, if you know everything 
Tell me why you couldn't see
That when I left I wanted you to 
Chase after me, yeah
I said leave but all I really want is you 
To stand outside my window
Throwing pebbles screaming "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 
Cause I know all I need is on 
The other side of the door
And I scream out the window
"I can't even look at you"
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say "there's nothing you can say
To make this right again
I mean it, I mean it"
What I mean is
I said leave but baby all I want is you 
To stand outside my window
Throwing pebbles screaming "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pouring rain
Come back for more
And don't you leave 
Cause I know all I need is on 
The other side of the door
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation 
With the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night 
You carry from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying
Was she worth this mess?
After everything in that little black dress
After everything I must confess 
I need you
