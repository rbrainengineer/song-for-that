Song: 
Album: 
what in the world is happening to me
I've already tried to shake your memory
I don't know why it is I can't get over you
cus' honey you ain't worth this pain I'm going through
you told me that your love would heal my broken heart
so I let you in my world and you tore it all apart
what in the world is happening to me
I've already tried to shake your memory
I dont know why it is I cant get over you
cus' honey you ain't worth this pain I'm going through
I should have known you weren't the kind to ever settle down
always leaving me alone while you did your runnin 'round
oh tell me what in the world did you do to me
I'm sick and tired of trying to shake your memory 
I don't know why it is I can't get over you
cus' honey you aint worth this pain I'm going through
I said honey you ain't worth this pain I'm going through
