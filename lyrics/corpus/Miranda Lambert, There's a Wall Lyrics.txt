Song: 
Album: 
I'd run away but I can't escape
The power of your pride
Your eyes are cold like an empty soul
And I'm burning up inside
There's nothing wrong with letting go
And you're still digging in
We're racing to the bottom
And I can't find the end
And there's a wall standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder
And you keep getting stronger
You won't break 'cause you're afraid you'll fall
And there's a wall
You love me when you want to
And you find reasons to fight
Another lame excuse
To keep the devil on you side
You're trying hard to hide those scars
That I've already seen
Your beat up heart's not the only thing
that's keeping you from me
And there's a wall standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder
And you keep getting stronger
You won't break 'cause you're afraid you'll fall
And there's a wall
Pain has made you weak and hard
I will never be as strong...As strong
As this wall standing here between us
And that's all that's keeping you from freedom
And I keep pushing harder
And you keep getting stronger
You won't break cause you're afraid you'll fall
And there's a wall
