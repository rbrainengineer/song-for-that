Song: 
Album: 
Oh , baby I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready to let you go
My hands are shakin'
My heart's unsteady
Oh, how I once loved you so
I know all the magic's gone
Wish I had a magic wand
I would put a spell on you
You would see it as I do
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh, baby you're my drug
And I was just your cigarette
I was nothing you could be proud of
I have lost my self-respect
My self-respect, self-respect
I have lost my self-respect
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh, I'm getting ready to let you go
Oh, baby, baby I got no traction
I've been waitin' and waitin' for your reaction
Sure, I tried a new direction
I'm gonna give myself a ressurection
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready to let you go
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready
I'm getting ready to let you go
Let you go
