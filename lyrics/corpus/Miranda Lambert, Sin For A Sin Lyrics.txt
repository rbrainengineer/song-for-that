Song: 
Album: 
I remember vividly what that vision did to me
You laying with her in our bed
Love can be a tragedy when you do what you did to me
All I’m seeing now is red
I need to repent
A sin for a sin
Bible told me to forgive all those who trespass against
Tread their feet on sacred ground, bad things come with consequence
What feels good hurts in the end
Don’t want to think about that now
I need to repent
A sin for a sin
Fire and brimstone, dirt and a headstone
Bury ‘em baby, all of our sins
Hear the thunder six feet under
Hit your knees, won’t do it again
Guilty pleasure, ease the pain
Whiskey runnin’ through my veins
Too late to save you now
I need to repent
A sin for a sin
Fire and brimstone, dirt and a headstone
Bury ‘em baby, all of our sins
Hear the thunder six feet under
Hit your knees, won’t do it again
I remember vividly what that vision did to me
