Song: 
Album: 
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous.
He says everything I need to hear 
And it’s like I couldn’t ask for anything better.
He opens up my door and
I get into his car and he says 
you look beautiful tonight. 
And I feel perfectly fine.
[Chorus:]
But I miss screamin’ and fightin’ and kissin’ in the rain
and its 2am and I’m cursin’ your name.
You’re so in love that you act insane 
and that’s the way I loved you. 
Breakin’ down and comin’ undone
it’s a roller coaster kinda rush.
And I never knew I could feel that much.
And that’s the way I loved you.
He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will.
He’s close to my mother 
Talks business with my father. 
He’s charming and endearing 
And I’m comfortable. 
But I miss screamin’ and fightin’ and kissin’ in the rain
And it’s 2am and I’m cursin’ your name.
You’re so in love that you act insane 
And that’s the way I loved you. 
Breakin’ down and comin’ undone
It’s a roller coaster kinda rush.
And I never knew I could feel that much.
And that’s the way I loved you.
He can’t see the smile I’m fakin’.
And my hearts not breakin’
Cause I’m not feelin’ anything at all.
And you were wild and crazy.
Just so frustrating, intoxicating, complicated, 
got away like some mistake. 
And now I, 
I miss screamin’, and fightin’, and kissin’ in the rain
it’s 2am and I’m cursin’ your name.
I’m so in love that I acted insane. 
And that’s the way I loved you. 
Breakin’ down and comin’ undone
it’s a roller coaster kinda rush.
And I never knew I could feel that much.
And that’s the way I loved you.
And that’s the way I loved you.
Never knew I could feel that much.
And that’s the way I loved you.
