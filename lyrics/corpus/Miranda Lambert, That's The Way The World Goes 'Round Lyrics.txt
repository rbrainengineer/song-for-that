Song: 
Album: 
I know a gal got a lot to lose
She's a pretty nice lady but she’s kinda confused
Got muscles in her head ain't never been used
Thinks she owns half of this town
Starts drinking heavy gets a big red nose
And she beats her old man with her pantyhose
And takes him out and buys him new clothes
That's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
One minute you’re up and the next you’re down
It's a half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
Well I was sittin’ in the tub just a countin’ my toes
When the radiator broke and the water froze
Got stuck in the ice without any clothes
Naked as the eyes of a clown
I was crying ice cubes hoping that I'd croak
When the sun came through the window and the ice all broke
I said son of a gun man that’s just a joke
And that's the way that the world goes 'round
That's the way that the world goes 'round
One minute you’re up and the next you’re down
It's a half an inch of water and you think you're gonna drown
That's the way that the world goes 'round
