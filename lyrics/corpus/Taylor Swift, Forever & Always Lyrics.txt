Song: 
Album: 
Once upon a time 
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something, 
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding 
Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down 
We almost never speak
I don’t feel welcome anymore, 
Baby what happened please tell me
Cause one second it was perfect and now you’re halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone and he still hasn’t called
And then you feel so low you can’t feel nothin' at all
And you flash back to when he said forever and always
Ohh ohhh
And it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong
It rains when you’re here and it rains when you’re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest
Made you run and hide like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes; thought I knew you for a minute
Now I’m not so sure
So here’s to everything 
Coming down to nothing
Here’s to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going
Thought I knew for a minute
But I don’t anymore
And I stare at the phone he still hasn’t called
And then you feel so low you can’t feel nothin' at all
And you flash back to when he said forever and always
Ohh ohhh
And it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong
It rains when you’re here and it rains when you’re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn’t mean it baby, 
I don’t think so
Ohhh ohhhh
Oh back up, baby back up, 
Did you forget everything
Back up, baby back up, 
Did you forget everything
Cause it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong
It rains when you’re here and it rains when you’re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Ohhh
I stare at the phone he still hasn’t called
And then you feel so low you can’t feel nothin' at all
And you flash back to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom 
Everything is wrong
It rains when you’re here and it rains when you’re gone
Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn’t mean it baby, you said forever and always
