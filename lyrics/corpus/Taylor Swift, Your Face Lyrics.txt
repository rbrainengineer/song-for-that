Song: 
Album: 
i heard a song tonight on the radio
another girl sings about a boy
she sees his face in every space, every room
and i know that if i turn around you won't be there
if i close my eyes, will you be there?
chorus:
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake up one day 
and not remember what time erased
i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face...
i've got a picture of you in my bedroom
and i hope it never falls
i hope i never lose that feelin 
i used to get when you called
and then i wonder to myself
who are you, where are you, where you ever here at all?
chorus:
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake up one day 
and not remember what time erased
i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face...
that girl in the song had it so good
i wish i could close my eyes and see you
i wish the sky had your face
and the oceans had your eyes
and the sunset had your lips
and i had you....
chorus:
oh, yeah
i don't wanna lose your face
and i don't wanna wake up one day 
and not remember what time erased
and i don't wanna turn around
cause i'm not scared of what love gave me and took away
and i don't wanna lose your face 
oh, no, no
i don't wanna lose your face
i don't wanna turn around
oh, oh, oh...
