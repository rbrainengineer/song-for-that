Song: 
Album: 
your beautiful eyes stare right into mine
and sometimes i think of you late at night
i don't know why
i wanna be somewhere where you are
i wanna be where...
chorus:
your here, your eyes are lookin into mine
so baby, make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
i'm lookin through your
i'm lookin through your eyes..
i wake up, i'm alive
in only a little while, i'll cry
cause your my lullaby 
so baby, come hold me tight
cause i, i wanna be everything you need
i wanna be where...
chorus:
your here, your eyes are lookin into mine
so baby, make me fly
my heart has never felt this way before
i'm lookin through your
i'm lookin through your eyes..
just as long as your mine
i'll be your everything tonight
let me love you, kiss you
baby, let me miss you
let me see your...
dream about, dream about your eyes
eyes, eyes, beautiful eyes...
