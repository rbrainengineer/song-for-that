Song: 
Album: 
She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
When ever she walks by
And you can't see me wanting you
the way you want her
But you are everything to me
And I just want to show you
She don't even know you
She's never going to love you
Like I want too
And You just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle
Unbelievable, instead of just invisible
Yeah,
There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through.
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do
And all I think about
Is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be
And I just want to show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you
Like i want too
And you just see right through me
If you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle
Unbelievable, instead of just invisible.
Like shadows in a faded light
We're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
and make you realize
I just want to show you
She don't even know you
Baby let me love you, let me want you.
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful miracle,
Unbelievable, instead of just invisible.
She can't see the way your eyes
light up when you smile.
