I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication, miscomunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should have held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending, why are we pretending this is nothing
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battles in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down if you said you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Now, now
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate cause were going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
The End
