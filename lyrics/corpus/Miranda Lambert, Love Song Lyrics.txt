Song: 
Album: 
I was standing there cryin’ in the kitchen
It’s been one of those mornings that’s gonna last all day
And he comes in, wraps his arms around me
And I don’t even have to say a thing
That’s what makes it love
That’s what makes it a love song
He comes in, slams the door behind him
He can’t hide the worry on his face
Even though I got a million things to tell him
I know right now he just needs some space
That’s what makes it love
That’s what makes it a love song
That’s what makes it love
That’s what makes it a love song
Everybody always sings about it
How they’re never gonna live without it
We don’t even have to talk about it
‘Cause we’re living it out
That’s what makes it love
That’s what makes it a love song
That’s what makes it love
That’s what makes it a love song
