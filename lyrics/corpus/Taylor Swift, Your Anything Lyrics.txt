Song: 
Album: 
i bet you lie awake at night
trying to make up your sweet mind
wondering if you'll ever find
just what you want
a home-town number one
or a california loaded gun
but you know you only get one
or that's what you thought
but here's what you've got
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes in the knees 
in the bottom of the top drawer
i could be your little beauty queen 
just a little out of reach
or the girl livin next door
i'll be your angel giving up her wings
if that's what you need 
i'd give everything to be your anything
if you want hard to get
if you want...
all you have to do is let me know
if you want a bumpy ride
or someone with a softer side
either one'll be alright
just let me know
cause this is where it goes
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes in the knees 
in the bottom of the top drawer
i could be your little beauty queen 
just a little outta reach
or the girl livin next door
i'll be your angel givin up her wings
if that's whatchya need
i'd give everything to be your anything
it's not like i'm givin up who i am for you
but for someone like you it's just so easy to do
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes in the knees 
in the bottom of the top drawer
i could be your little beauty queen 
just a little outta reach
or the girl livin next door
i'll be your angel givin up her wings
if that's whatchya need...
if that's whatchya need
i could be your favorite blue jeans
with the holes in the knees 
in the bottom of the top drawer
i could be your little beauty queen 
just a little outta reach
or the girl livin next door
i'll be your angel givin up her wings
if that's whatchya need
i'd give everything to be your anything
