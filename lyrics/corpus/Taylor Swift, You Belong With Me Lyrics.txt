Song: 
Album: 
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, She's upset
She's goin' off about somethin' that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kinda music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
You're walkin' the streets with you an' your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench thinkin' to myself
Hey isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while, since she brought you down
You say you're fine I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
'Cause she wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see? 
You belong with me
You Belong with me
Oh I remember you were drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong. Think I know it's with me.
Can't you see that I'm the one who understand you?
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me
You belong with me
Standing by here waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
