(Travis Howard)
I can’t be bothered to miss you anymore
It's month 12, day 31 and hour 24
I used to think if missed hard enough
You’d come back for sure
But I can’t be bothered now to miss you anymore
It’s not like I don’t have tears to cry
Such memories, so little time
This box of photographs to go through one by one
There’s just so much work to get done 
And I can’t be bothered to miss you anymore
It's month 12, day 31 and hour 24
I used to think if missed hard enough you’d come back for sure
And I can’t be bothered now to miss you anymore
When you skipped town
I was such a mess
So I found some things
To do instead
Trick is to find something
To occupy your mind
Now I spend most days
chasing mine
And I can’t be bothered to miss you anymore
Month 12, day 31 and hour 24
I used to think if missed hard enough you’d come back for sure
And I can’t be bothered now to miss you, I’m cuddling up to kiss you
And I can’t be bothered now to miss you anymore
