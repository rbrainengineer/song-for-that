Song: 
Album: 
Down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts are what I'm breakin'
There's a strong man lives up in Jackson Hole
He took my heart and he broke my soul
Left a dark place in my chest
I sleep but I don't rest
I sleep but I don't rest 
So down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts are what I'm breakin'
Met a little boy in Baton Rouge
His eyes were clear and his heart was true
I made that boy's heart scream my name
But he didn't know the game
No he didn't know the game
So down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts are what I'm breakin'
You don't want to be standing there
When the storm hits you won't have a prayer
My wind will blow you to your knees
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Stay away from me
Oh yeah down is where I'm goin'
Pain is what I'm showin'
Love is what I'm takin'
Hearts are what I'm breakin'
Hearts are what I'm breakin'
