Song: 
Album: 
Cheap red wine straight out of a coffee cup
One more down to drink you off my mind
Lord knows I tried a thousand times to give you up
But it’s closing time
We both know why
(Chorus)
I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run
We’ve been driving down the highway
Now we’re out of gas and too far out of town
Oh, and here we are all tangled up and sideways
You’re all broken down
Yeah, I’m breaking down
(Chorus)
I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run
Oh, and maybe somewhere a little down the line
I’ll get a little better leaving us behind
Maybe someday, oh I’ll be fine
And you’ll move on and I will too
But still I don’t see getting over you
Oh, no no
(Chorus)
I’m just too selfish I guess
I know you’re tired and restless
It’s no surprise we’ve come undone
But I can’t unlove you just because
You say it’s better in the long run
In the long run
Ohhh, in the long run
In the long run
In the long run
