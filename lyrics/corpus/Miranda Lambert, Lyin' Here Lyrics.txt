Song: 
Album: 
I love you more than you'll ever know 
and I miss you more than I care to show 
I'll get better at pretending nothings wrong its easy when you're always all alone 
Lately I see leaving in your eyes though nothing you say will come as a surprise
You don't even have to try to be sincere Just go on and leave me lyin' here
I'll tell my heart it didnt cause it to break well I'll tell my mind that 
I'm the one who made the mistakes and I'll tell my
eyes they don't even have to cry one tear 
Just go on and leave me lyin' here
So go on and find you someone new 
I'll make sure that I am but the fool maybe someday 
I'll begin to make it clear you're the one who left me lyin' here 
And I'll tell my heart ya didn't cause it to break 
And I'll tell my mind that I'm the one who made the mistake 
And I'll tell my eyes they dont even have to cry one tear 
so go on and leave me lyin' here 
Just walk away and 
leave me lyin' here
