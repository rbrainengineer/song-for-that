Song: 
Album: 
I bet this road will take me out of here
Take me far away from Amarillo
I bet this car will go real fast
The wheels might even drive me past
The places that you said I'd never go
Oh . . .
The Texas Sky is the biggest one I've seen
But it still ain't big enough for you and me
All the things that make you mad
And all the baggage in your past
Don't leave much room for a girl like me to be
So, I'll fill her up with hope and worn-out dreams
And I'll grab the wheel and point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
I'll drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get too far
On a tank of gas and an empty heart
But I've got everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings
Mama said I never should have done it
Should have ended us before we ever started
Daddy knew about my pride 
So he stood there and he smiled inside
And I pretended that I didn't notice
A little tear that fell when I said I was going
And I'll grab the wheel and point it west
Pack the good and leave the rest
I'll drive until I find the missing piece
You said I wouldn't get too far 
On a tank of gas and an empty heart
But I have everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings
And I've worried about life and if it's arriving right on time
I guess if you don't jump, you'll never know if you can fly
You said I wouldn't get too far 
On a tank of gas and an empty heart
But I have everything I'll ever need
I got this old guitar and a brand new set of strings
