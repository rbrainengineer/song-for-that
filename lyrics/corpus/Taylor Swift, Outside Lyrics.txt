Song: 
Album: 
I didn't know, what I would find, when I went lookin for a reason
I know, I didnt read between the lines, and baby ive got nowhere to go
i tried to take the road less traveled by
but nothin seems to work the first few times am i right
so how could i ever, try to be better
nobody ever, lets me in
and i can still see you, this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been alot of lonely places i've
never been on the outside
you saw me there, but never knew
that i would give it all up to be
a part of this, a part of you
and now its all too late so you see
you could have helped if you had wanted to
but no one notices until its too, late to do anything
how could i ever, try to be better
nobody ever, lets me in
and i can still see you, this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been alot of lonely places i've
never been on the outside
oh, yeah
how can i ever, try to be better
nobody ever, lets me in
and i can still see you, this aint the best view
on the outside looking in
ive been alot of lonely places i've
never been on the outside
oh oh
oh oh oh
oh oh
oh oh
