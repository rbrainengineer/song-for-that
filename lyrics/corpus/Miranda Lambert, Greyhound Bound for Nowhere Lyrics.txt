Song: 
Album: 
Rain on the window makes me lonely
And time keeps passing so slowly
The old man sittin' next to me is fallin' asleep
On a Greyhound bound for nowhere
The sun's going down on my misery 
Another day gone by with broken dreams
That cell phone I hear ringin'
I keep wishin' it was you
On a Greyhound bound for nowhere
And that ring that you were wearin'
Don't mean everything
And the way you stood starin'
As you watched me roll away
She loves you and you need me
And there's some things we can't share
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
Bright lights of a city shinin' up ahead
My heart's analyzin' every word you said
Did you take me for a fool
Or did you really care
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
And that ring that you were wearin'
Don't mean everything
And the way that you stood starin'
As you watched me roll away
She loves you and you need me
And there's some things we can't share
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
And I'm gonna find someplace I can ease my mind
And try to heal my wounded pride
Rain on the window and I'm still lonely
And time keeps on passin' so slowly
You're with her and I'm alone
And you're wishin' I was there
I'm on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
We're all on a Greyhound bound for nowhere
Ooh
