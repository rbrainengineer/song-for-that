Song: 
Album: 
I know he loved you
A long time ago 
I ain't jealous of you
Just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him
Or anything like me
So you might as well sit back cause I ain't
trying to show maturity
X is the shape I drew through your face 
in permanent marker, oh
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
in permanent marker
Well I found that picture
Of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time
Cleanin' up that mess
He found thirty other pieces
But he'll never find them all
Tried to tape them back together
Now he knows to keep them off the wall
X is the shape I drew through your face 
in permanent marker, oh
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
in permanent marker
Well I don't appreciate you callin him to reminisce
The only reason is you're seein just how much better off he is
X is the shape I drew through your face 
in permanent marker, oh yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
in permanent marker
X is the shape I drew through your face 
in permanent marker, oh
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart
in permanent marker
In permanent marker
Permanent marker
