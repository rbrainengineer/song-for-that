Song: 
Album: 
(Miranda Lambert, Rick Lambert &amp; Heather Little)
Gives you something you can do with your hands 
Makes you look cool and feel like a man 
In the morning you'll probably regret me 
Me and your cigarettes 
Started young, it's too late to quit 
Most call it a bad bad habit 
Your mama told you you could end up dead with me 
Me and your cigarettes 
Always there every time you need me 
It ain't love, it's just like nicotine 
You're addicted to a feeling you can only get 
From me and your cigarettes 
Light us up and then throw us down 
Walk away when we hit the ground 
How's it gonna feel when you come back around here and see 
It's just you and your cigarettes 
Always there every time you need me 
It ain't love, it's just like nicotine 
You're addicted to a feeling you can only get 
From me and your cigarettes
