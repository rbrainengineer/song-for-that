Song: 
Album: 
How long has it taken me to find you?
500 years, 500 thousand miles
It don’t matter now
Love’s always on time
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky
Lightening flashed, everything went silent
A feather could have knocked me to the floor
Missing piece was found
I was finally alive
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky
With the speed of sound
I’m homeward bound
Mmmhmmm
All our sorrows swept away forever
Each and every tear washed out to sea
There ain’t no goodbye with your hand in mine
Meet me underneath the Oklahoma sky
Oklahoma sky
