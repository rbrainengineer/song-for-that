Song: 
Album: 
I’m waitin’ on the sun to set cause yesterday ain't over yet
I started smokin' cigarettes there's nothin' else to do, I guess
Dusty roads ain't made for walkin', spinnin' tires ain't made for stoppin’
I’m givin' up on love cause love’s given up on me
I gave it everything I had, and everything I got was bad
Life ain't hard but it’s too long to live it like some country song
Trade the truth in for a lie, cheatin' really ain't a crime
I’m givin' up on love cause love’s given up on me
Forget your high society, I’m soakin’ it in kerosene
Light ‘em up and watch them burn, teach them what they need to learn, HA!
Dirty hands ain't made for shakin’, ain't a rule that ain't worth breakin’
Well I’m givin' up on love cause love’s given up on me
Now I don’t hate the one who left 
You can't hate someone who's dead 
He’s out there holdin' onto someone, I’m holdin' up my smokin' gun
I’ll find somewhere to lay my blame the day she changes her last name
Well I’m givin' up on love cause love’s given up on me
Well I’m givin' up on love, HEY love’s given up on me
