Song: 
Album: 
The weatherman says rain today
We'll saddle up and be on our way
What's a little rain to a high ridin' rebel or two
'Cause it's easy living, easy loving you
People keep searchin' for a reason why
They say, "life's a bitch and then you die",
But I can't see a reason for their point of view
'Cause it's easy living, easy loving you
Talkshows talkin' how it's near the end of the one man woman and the one woman man
We might fight like dogs but hey, we love the makin up at the end of the day
Tomorrow that ole sun will rise
I'll be layin here by your side
Coffee cup and a good mornin' kiss or two
Cause it's easy living, easy loving you
Cause it's easy living, easy loving you
[Thanks to Casey for lyrics]
