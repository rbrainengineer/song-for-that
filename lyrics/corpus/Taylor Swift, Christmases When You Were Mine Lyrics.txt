Please take down the mistleoe
Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
Mama's in the kitchen worrying about me
Seasons greetings hope you're well
I'm doing alright if you were wondering
Lately I can never tell
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
Eveybody's here except you, baby
Seems like everyon's got someone to hold
But for me it's just a lonely time
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
Merry Christmas everynbody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
Bet you got your mom another sweater
Were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases whe I didn't
Wonder how you are tonight
Cause there were Christmases when you were mine
