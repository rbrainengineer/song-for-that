Song: 
Album: 
I’ve been missing all the vital signs
That I needed for love to work
Engine of a heart that would not start
Had to jump it so much it hurt
Every time I looked under the hood
It was always a mystery
You pulled up in the rescue truck
Showed up with a master key
And revved it up for me
CHORUS
My pulse was nearly gone
I was almost in need of a defibrillator 
I didn’t know what went wrong
Had to shake it off, but I got stuck
Oh my God
You turned all my loose strings
You’re the love innovator that brings all the right tools
You know what to do, fine tune
You started tweaking on a little knob
That I didn’t even know was there
Kissing on my wrist, all the way to my neck
Running your fingers through my hair
I felt like I was dizzy
And I didn’t think I could drive
You flipped a switched, hotwired my keys
Yeah, you put me in line
And now I’m running right
CHORUS x2
