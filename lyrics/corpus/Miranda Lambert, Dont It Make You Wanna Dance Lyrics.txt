Song: 
Album: 
I've been gone for so long
it feels so good just to get back home
back to all my friends and all the faces I like to see
and like a rainbow in the sky
a certain twinkle is in his eye
tellin me that they believe in who I am and who I want to be
don't it make you want to dance
and dont it make you want to smile
when you down and around
down in the country big and sing a while
and dont it make you awant to dance 
and dont it make you want to smile
when your down and around 
down in the country big and sing a while
oh lord don't it feel right tonight
makin music when the feelings right
feeling better with every little single song
i look around and everyone is a friend
and every single one is bound to grin
and when the chorus comes around everybody jump on
and dont it make you want to dance and dont it make you want to smile
when youre down and around
down in the country big and sing awhile
and dont it make you want to dance 
and dont it make you want to smile
when your down and out
down in the country big and sing awhile
when youre down and around in the country 
big and sing awhile
