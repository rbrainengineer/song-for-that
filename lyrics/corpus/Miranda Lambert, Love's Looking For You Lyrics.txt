Song: 
Album: 
Maybe you're just jaded from some nobody's unforgotten words
Maybe you're just faded a little gray from every time that you've been hurt
So you're looking for your skin
That you never did fit in
You can't hide when you're turned inside out
Love is looking for you now
Maybe you've been burning
But you can't blow out a flame that you can't find
Maybe you've been thirsty
But the rain just ain't enough when you're this dry
So you're running from the water
And the fire's getting hotter
I think you better find some level ground
Love is looking for you now
Love is looking for you now
Maybe you been wearing
The shoes that someone else is wearing now
Maybe you've been swearing forever might have already run out
You can't love yourself at the expense of someone else
You can't hide a liar from the truth
Love is looking for you
Love is looking for you
I've been looking for you
Baby I've been lookin...
I've been looking for you
