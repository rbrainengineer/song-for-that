Song: 
Album: 
[verse 1]
You got the bullets;
I got the gun.
I got a hankerin'
For gettin' into somethin'.
I hit the bottle;
You hit the gas.
I heard your '65
could really haul some ass.
[verse 2]
I'm feelin' frisky;
You're feelin' good.
I guess the whiskey
Is doin' what it should.
I got the cigarettes;
You got a lighter,
And when the sun goes down
we'll start a little fire,
[chorus 1]
Ain't no use in tryin'
To slow me down
'Cause you're runnin'
With the fastest girl in town.
Ain't your baby!
I like 'em crazy!
[verse 3]
My reputation
Follows me around.
Just makes me wanna give 'em
More to talk about.
Let's go to town
for a little while.
I'll be wearing nothin'
But a tattoo and a smile.
[chorus 2]
Ain't no use in tryin'
to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin'
With the fastest girl in town.
Ain't your baby!
You're kinda crazy!
Come on!
[guitar solo 1]
[verse 4]
I see the blue lights;
We better run.
Throw out the bottle,
and I'll have the gun.
If he pulls us over
I'll turn on the charm.
You'll be in the slammer,
And I'll be on his arm.
[chorus 3]
Ain't no use in tryin'
to slow me down
'Cause you're runnin'
With the fastest girl in town.
Ain't your baby!
Well I told ya I was crazy!
No, I ain't nobody's baby!
Huh!
[guitar solo 2]
[outro]
He's got the bullets;
He's got a gun.
I got the hankerin'
For gettin' into somethin'.
