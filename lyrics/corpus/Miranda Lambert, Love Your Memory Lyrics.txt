Song: 
Album: 
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
I can't handle all this pain
All we ever do is fight anyway
Why we even tried I haven't a clue
With hearts involved
There's way too much to lose
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
You were something else to look at
Your intentions they weren't all bad
Tried to make me something I wasn't
Lord knows there ain't no future
In all that
I don't want to see you or feel you
I don't want to look into your eyes
I don't want to touch you or miss you
I just want to love your memory tonight
