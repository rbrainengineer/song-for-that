Song: 
Album: 
God knows I tried everything I could to stay inside tonight
But that boy's like a sore in your mouth that you just have to bite
Him number one is shakin' hands with numbers two and three
Is it guilty in here or is it just me
I've made a point of not mixing love and pleasure in my life
'Cause daytime boys and nighttime boys
Usually don't see eye to eye
But I've been on a roll of late and they're all down on their knees
Is it guilty in here or is it just me
What became of all the boys who only want one thing
Someone tell me what I'm doing wrong
'Cause the good ones all got wedding rings
And the young ones are just too dumb
And I don't think I have anymore room underneath my thumb
Maybe after all the ends do justify the means
Is it guilty in here or is it just me
What became of all the boys who only want one thing
Someone tell me what I'm doing wrong
'Cause the good ones all got wedding rings
And the young ones are just too dumb
And I don't think I have anymore room underneath my thumb
I think after all the ends do justify the means
Is it guilty in here, is it just me
Is it guilty in here maybe it's just me
