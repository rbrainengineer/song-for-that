Song: 
Album: 
Well the sun just got through going down
On a sleepy little Texas town
Population plus one, minus one
A new grandma rocks my sister's kid
Just like 20 years ago she did
The same thing in that same chair
She said this one's born to run
Every day at noon like a chapel bell
Find her Jesus keep her well
Help her do more right than wrong, at the end of the day
I've got five good gears and a tank of gas,
50 watts and Johnny Cash
A guitar and a broken heart
Just full of things to say
You taught me how to stand those tests and trials
But you can't see a desert sunrise in the Bible
She loves me more than anything
And she wants the world for me
Her west dropped off in El Paso
And her north in Abilene
Mama I'm okay out here
I've seen how hard the world can be
My step is sure and I know my name
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
If I had done what you and daddy'd done
I would have never lost and never won
Or gotten myself kicked when I was down
I would not know how to travel well
A hundred bucks and cheap motels
I would not know how to fight for my own heart next time around
Don't you cry another night about me
In this city I've got angels all around me
She loves me more than anything
And she wants the world for me
Her west dropped off in El Paso
And her north in Abilene
Mama I'm okay out here
I've seen how hard the world can be
My step is sure and I know my name
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
I felt it every time you prayed for me
I'm strong just like you prayed I'd be
