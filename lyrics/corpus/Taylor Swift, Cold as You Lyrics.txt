Song: 
Album: 
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take
You take the very best of me
So I start a fight 
Cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want
Cause I'm not what you wanted.
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending 
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away
No use defending words 
That you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here 
Thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere 
Cold as you
You put up walls and paint them 
All a shade of gray
And I stood there lovin you 
And wished them all away
And you come away
With a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer
With the nerve to adore you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending 
Given to a perfect day
So just walk away
No use defending words 
That you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here 
Thinkin' it through
I've never been anywhere 
Cold as you
You never did give a damn thing honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody 
If I died, died for you
Died for you
Oh, what a shame
What a rainy ending 
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake
Is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here 
Thinking it through
I've never been anywhere 
Cold as you
