Song: 
Album: 
Just like the fringe on my boots you move with every step I take
You walk in front of me to make sure that I don’t fall and break
My own heart cause with you I could never
Just like the leather on my saddle we get prettier with time
Together in the weather shiny on the other side
Polished and changed for the better
With you I’m safe
With you I’m safe
I follow you just like a shadow only closer and
If you get tied and bound I’ll find a way to free your hands
I’ll wash them clean of everything but me
Sometimes you might get thirsty so I’ll catch the rain
Just like the ice in your glass I’ll rattle when you need a drink
We’ll never run dry on love or anything
I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe
I keep a locket on my neck that holds your face
I’ll spend forever making sure I can erase
Every tear you ever thought about crying
You make me feel like I’m the only girl in the whole wide world
I wanna hold you like a hand full of diamonds and pearls
That I guard with my life or die trying
I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe
I’ll keep you safe
Safe
