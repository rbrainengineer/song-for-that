Song: 
Album: 
(Miranda Lambert)
You draw it out like a highway 
With every word you'd say
Excuses for the answers that you lack
Your mama’s still the steady ground
you walk on every day
And your daddy’s still the monkey on your back
Did you find all you thought you’d find out in the wild, wild west
You took a little piece of home and you threw away the rest
You say you’re livin’ on the edge
and I think you’re hangin’ from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand
that wants to help you up
Are you the man you thought you’d be
by the time that you turned 33?
Are you still a bullet in your daddy’s gun?
Don’t forget boy you’re your mama’s only son
She’s at home and she’s been prayin' for ya
So what about Georgia?
I saw your sister yesterday
Austin’s five and on his way
Looking for some shoes that he can fill
He said that he’d be just like you
the coolest guy he ever knew 
And he’d find you when
he lost his training wheels
I looked in his big blue eyes
and I saw you again
He’s hungry for a life he ain't ready to begin
You say you’re livin’ on the edge
And I think you’re hangin’ from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand
That wants to help you up
Are you the man you thought you’d be
By the time that you turned 33?
Are you still a bullet in your daddy’s gun?
Don’t forget boy you’re your mama’s only son
She’s at home and she’s been prayin' for ya
So what about Georgia?
I guess you didn’t realize it’d take you quite this long
To figure out that being free is right where you belong
You say you’re livin’ on the edge
And I think you’re hangin’ from a ledge
Too scared to hold the hand
That wants to help you up
HEY! Are you the man you thought you’d be
by the time that you turned 33?
Are you still a bullet in your daddy’s gun?
Don’t forget boy you’re your mama’s only son
She’s at home and she’s been prayin' for ya
So what about Georgia?
What about Georgia? yeah
What about Georgia Georgia? Yeah
What about Georgia?
