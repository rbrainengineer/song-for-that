Song: 
Album: 
Ilsa was an acrobat who went and fell in love
With that Horatio the human cannonball
A wedding 'neath the big top tent with Barkers, clowns, and elephants
Side show family, oddities and all
The dog-faced bay howled out with joy
As the tattooed lady was cryin'
Ever since the beginning,
To keep the world spinnign
It takes all kinds of kinds
Thomas was a congressman
With closets full of skeletons
And dresses that he wore on Friday nights
Phyllis was a pharmacist, a dab of that, a pinch of this
Concocted to suppress her appetite
When the children were fiddlin', she'd slip 'em some Ritalin
And wait for Thomasina to arrive
Ever since the beginning,
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
When I play this old guitar, from children's shows to smoky bars
I take a break and think about the past
When I stood up in geometry and everybody stared at me
And I tossed by text into the trash
I scratched off my number while hitching out under
That bush league population sign
Ever since the beginning, 
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
Some point the finger, let ignorance linger
If they'd look in the mirror they'd find
Ever since the beginning,
To keep the world spinning
It takes all kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
All kinds of kinds
