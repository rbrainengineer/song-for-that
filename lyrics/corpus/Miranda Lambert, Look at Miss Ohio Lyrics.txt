Chorus:
Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She's runnin' around with her rag top down
She says, 'I wanna do right, but not right now'
I'm gonna drive to Atlanta and live out this fantasy
of runnin' around with your rag top down
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now
Have your arm around her shoulder
a regimental soldier
And mamma starts pushin' that weddin' gown 
She says,'I wanna do right but not right now
Chorus:
Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She's runnin' around with her rag top down
She says,'I wanna do right but not right now'
I know all about it, so you don't have to shout it
But I'm gonna straighten it out somehow
Yeah, I wanna do right but not right now
Chorus:
Oh me oh my oh, would you look at Miss Ohio
She's runnin' around with her rag top down
She says,'I wanna do right but not right now. Not right now'
Yeah I wanna do right but not right now.
