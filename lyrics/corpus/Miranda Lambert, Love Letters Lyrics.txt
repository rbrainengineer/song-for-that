Song: 
Album: 
Love letters on wet paper forgivers and no takers
An angel who never got wings
You find Jesus and it's too late he's already closed the front gate
And the sign's flashin' no vacancy
You've broken my heart for the last time
You promised the truth and you told lies
You really made me believe
That love was supposed to be free
Love letters on wet paper forgivers and no takers
An angel who never got wings 
You find Jesus and it's too late he's already closed the front gate
And the sign's flashin' no vacancy
I'll never forget how we used to be
But I'm better off livin' with memories
I know that it's gonna hurt
But I don't think it gets any worse
Than love letters on wet paper forgivers and no takers
An angel who never got wings
You find Jesus and it's too late he's already closed the front gate
And the signs flashin' no vacancy
Yeah my heart's flashing no vacancy
