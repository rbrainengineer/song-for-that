Song: 
Album: 
So here you are in your borrowed car
Kicking rocks around looking at your shoes
It’s the same old you
Tell me where you’ve been
Where you going to?
Where were you last night?
Boy, listen up when I’m talking to you
It’s the same old you
Another lonely night with that same old whiskey morning
(Chorus)
It’s the same old you when you get to drinkin’
Same old you when you’re on the town
Same old you in church on Sunday
Getting high when the sun goes down
Well this time I’ve done some thinking
And I think I’m done with you
Cause until I get to leaving it’s just the same old me too
Well your momma’s gonna cry her eyes
There ain’t gonna be no wedding day
What’s she gonna say
When I tell her how I had no choice
Same old you couldn’t even raise your voice and ask me to stay
I wouldn’t anyway
So you can keep your ring and I’ll keep my daddy’s name
(Chorus)
It’s the same old you when you get to drinkin’
Same old you when you’re on the town
Same old you in church on Sunday
Getting high when the sun goes down
This time I’ve done some thinking
And I think I’m done with you
Cause until I get to leaving it’s just the same old me too
Doo do do do doo
Cause until I get to leaving it’s just the same old me too
