Song: 
Album: 
Turn WYCD on
You're on your Grunwald
Back from the Amazon
Ah huh huh
He's here with doctor Don
I heard they dropped him off
In the amazon
Ah huh huh
He caught an anaconda
Ate some piranhas
That's kinda disgusting
But whatever makes you happy
And I heard some naked boy
Showed him around
Yeah
Grunwald's back in town
