Song: 
Album: 
Cory's eyes are like a jungle
he smiles, it's like the radio
he whispers songs into my window 
in words nobody knows 
there's pretty girls on every corner
that watch him as he's walking home
saying, does he know
will you ever know
chorus:
you're beautiful
every little piece, love, don't you know 
you're really gonna be someone, ask anyone
when you find everything you've looked for 
i hope your life leads you back to my door 
oh but if it don't, stay beautiful
cory finds another way to be
the highlight of my day
i'm taking pictures in my mind
so i can save them for a rainy day 
it's hard to make conversation 
when he's taking my breathe away
i should say, hey by the way...
repeat chorus
if you and i are a story 
that never gets told
if what you are is a daydream
i'll never get to hold, at least you'll know
you're beautiful
every little piece, love, don't you know 
you're really gonna be someone, ask anyone
when you find everything you've looked for 
i hope your life leads you back to my front door 
oh but if it don't, will you stay beautiful beautiful beatiful...
beautiful beautiful beautiful
ohh ohh ohhh
oh but if it don't
Stay Beautiful
Stay Beautiful
